    }
    ```

Use these endpoints to access the data you need from the British Columbia Childcare API.

## Data Sources

The data used in this application is sourced from the British Columbia government's data catalog, specifically from the dataset titled ["Child Care Map Data"](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/child-care-map-data/resource/9a9f14e1-03ea-4a11-936a-6e77b15eeb39). The data is provided in CSV format and includes essential information about childcare centers throughout British Columbia, such as their names, addresses, coordinates, and vacancy status.

**Data Update Frequency:** The dataset is updated on a daily basis to ensure that the information remains current and accurate.

**GitHub Actions for Daily Updates:** To keep the data up-to-date, this repository utilizes GitHub Actions. A daily workflow is set up to automatically fetch the latest data from the source CSV and update the dataset within the application.

By leveraging GitHub Actions, this API guarantees that users have access to the most recent childcare information available in British Columbia.

For more details on how data updates are managed, please refer to the [GitHub Actions](#data-updates) section.

## Data Updates

This API is updated daily using GitHub Actions. The data is refreshed from the source CSV file to ensure it remains up-to-date.

The GitHub Actions will compare the current version of the CSV with the latest one and update if necessary. The data update record can be found in the Git commits by [Actions User](https://github.com/actions-user).
